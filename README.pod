=head1 NAME

Array::FIFO - A Simple limitable FIFO array, with sum and average methods

=head1 VERSION

version 0.13

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ar = Array::FIFO->new( limit => 12 );
    $ar->add( 20 );
    $ar->add( 18 );
    $ar->add( 22 );

    say $ar->average;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Array::FIFO is meant to be a simple limitable array, for storing data in a FIFO
manner; with an optional limit to how large the array can get.  When the limit is
reached, the oldest value is returned by C<add> when new values are added.

It's intent is for numeric values (i.e. current load of a system), but it should work 
for other data types if you're not in need of the calculation methods.

The C<sum> and C<average> methods return the current sum and average of the 
data as you would expect.  It does this on once, then caches the result until
the array changes.


=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new>

=over 4

=item C<limit> (optional)

Numeric value of how large the array is allowed to get.  When it reaches 
limit, every item added causes the oldest item to be removed.

If no value is passed, there is no max size.


=back

=head2 C<add>

    $ar->add( 99 );

You can add any type of item to the array; if it's not a number it will be
treated as a value of 0 when when calculating sum() and average().

Returns the oldest element in the array.

=head2 C<remove>

    $ar->remove;

Remove the oldest item on the array.

=head2 C<queue>

    $ar->queue;

Reference directly the fifo array.

=head2 C<size>

    $ar->size;

How many elements are in the array.

=head2 C<limit>

    $ar->limit;

The maximum size the array is allowed to be.

=head2 C<sum>

    $ar->sum;

The sum of all numeric elements in the array.

=head2 C<average>

    $ar->average;

The average of all numeric elements in the array.
